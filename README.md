# This is the experimental code and detailed implementation documentation for the performance analysis of the three basic deep transfer learning paradigms—Pre-training–fine-tuning (PTFT), Statistical moment matching (SMM), and Domain adversarial training (DAT)—using the CWRU dataset in the review article “Deep Transfer Learning Technology-Based Condition Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of Electric Vehicle Electric Powertrain Systems: A Review.”
# In addition, we would like to express our special thanks to Zhao et al. for the open-source code in their paper "Applications of Unsupervised Deep Transfer Learning to Intelligent Fault Diagnosis: A Survey and Comparative Study," in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, vol. 70, pp. 1-28, 2021, Art no. 3525828, doi: 10.1109/TIM.2021.3116309. This code served as the foundation for our code.
